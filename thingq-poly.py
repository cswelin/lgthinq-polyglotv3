Import the polyglot interface module. This is in pypy so you can just install it
normally. Replace pip with pip3 if you are using python3.

Virtualenv:
pip install udi_interface

Not Virutalenv:
pip install udi_interface --user

  to maintain cleanliness, however that isn't required. Keep track of any
  other modules you install and add these to the requirements.txt file.
